# Convex Database Integration Setup

Your product marketplace has been successfully integrated with Convex database! Here's how to get it running:

## What's Been Done

### 1. Database Schema (`apps/backend/convex/schema.ts`)
- ✅ Added `products` table with comprehensive product data structure
- ✅ Includes all fields from your HTML data: category, make/model, condition, pricing, location, time ranges
- ✅ Proper indexing for efficient queries by seller, category, status, price, etc.

### 2. Database Functions (`apps/backend/convex/products.ts`)
- ✅ `createProduct` - Add new products to database
- ✅ `listProducts` - Query products with filters (category, price range, condition, etc.)
- ✅ `searchProducts` - Full-text search across product data
- ✅ `getProductById` - Get single product details
- ✅ `getProductsBySeller` - Get all products for a specific seller
- ✅ `updateProduct` - Modify existing products
- ✅ `deleteProduct` - Remove products
- ✅ `markProductSold` - Change product status to sold

### 3. Data Seeding (`apps/backend/convex/seedData.ts`)
- ✅ `seedProductData` - Populates database with sample products from your HTML data
- ✅ Creates sample users and all the products you had in JavaScript arrays
- ✅ Includes electronics, appliances, fans, and other categories

### 4. Updated Frontend (`marketplace-convex.html`)
- ✅ Replaced hardcoded JavaScript data with Convex database calls
- ✅ Dynamic product loading and searching
- ✅ Real-time product creation and management
- ✅ Seller dashboard with their own products
- ✅ Database seeding controls for initial setup

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Deploy to Convex (if not already done)
```bash
cd apps/backend
npx convex deploy
```

### 2. Update HTML File
Edit `marketplace-convex.html` and replace:
```javascript
const convex = new ConvexHttpClient(process.env.CONVEX_URL || "https://your-convex-deployment.convex.cloud");
```

With your actual Convex deployment URL:
```javascript
const convex = new ConvexHttpClient("https://YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_NAME.convex.cloud");
```

### 3. Open the HTML File
Open `marketplace-convex.html` in your browser and:
1. Click "🌱 Seed Database" to populate with sample data
2. Switch between Buyer and Seller profiles
3. Search and create products dynamically!

## Key Features

### For Buyers
- 🔍 **Real-time search** - Search by make, model, or category
- 🏷️ **Advanced filters** - Filter by category, price range, condition
- 📊 **Live results** - Products loaded directly from Convex database

### For Sellers
- ➕ **Dynamic product creation** - Add new products that persist in database
- 👤 **Multi-seller support** - Choose from existing sellers or add new ones
- 📈 **Seller dashboard** - View all products for selected seller
- ✏️ **Product management** - Create, view, and manage listings

### Database Benefits
- 💾 **Persistent storage** - Data survives browser refreshes
- ⚡ **Real-time updates** - Changes reflect immediately
- 🔄 **Scalable** - Can handle thousands of products
- 🛡️ **Type-safe** - Full TypeScript support with Convex schema
- 🔍 **Indexed queries** - Fast searches even with large datasets

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Functions**: Make sure all Convex functions are deployed
2. **Test Functionality**: Use the seeding button and create test products
3. **Customize**: Modify the schema and functions as needed for your use case
4. **Add Users**: Extend the user system with authentication if needed
5. **Mobile Optimize**: The interface is responsive but can be further optimized
